# Bash-Shell-Scripting

These are a series of bash shell scripts I wrote in order to automate various tools and or extract information about users systems.

The bread and butters of the code provided are: “Network_Data_Feed.sh”, “Encrypted_Folder.sh”, and  “Data_Feed.sh”, which all server to extract various data about the end-users system and store it into a text file, automating various commands and tools.
